# Poke-Search Tech Test

To get this project running you are going to need to run the following commands in order:

1. npm install (this will install all the relevant packages needed for the application that live within the node_modules folder)
2. npm start (this will spin up a development server in your browser)

If you are getting any build errors or its failing to run please reach out to me at: nathan.ryan355@gmail.com

Thanks
